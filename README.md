# Pattern Recognition AUTH
**Applying Readability Evaluation Techniques for Software Projects by Using Data Mining on Open Source Repositories.**
***
The project conducted by using programming language R and it was part of the subject Pattern Recognition in the curriculum of the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in May 2020.

Execute scripts by the following order:
1) FinalPreprocessing: preprocessing of the initial dataset.
2) FinalClusteringSmall: clustering the small codes data segment.
3) FinalClusteringHigh: clustering the high codes data segment.
4) FinalClassificationSmall: classifying the small codes data segment.
5) FinalClassificationHigh: classifying the high codes data segment.
6) ClusteringModelsComparison: comparing the clustering models. We run this script to decide which clustering algorithm to adopt.
7) sse_diagram: plotting SSE for diffrenent values of k.
8) (6) and (7) are not necessary to run, in order to reach the final results.
